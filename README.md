Tab Position Customizer 2
=========================

**Update**: I removed the extension from the web store after Google rejected the updates and threatened to suspend my account. I no longer even use this extension and it's become too much of a hassle and certainly not worth losing access to my account. If someone else would like to continue maintaining it, feel free to reach out.

Chrome extension to customize tab opening position and closing behavior.

Based on the Tab Position Customizer extension.  I changed the name, the icon and removed some code that was accessing Google Analytics.  I left the other language files alone.  If you speak one of those languages, send me an update.

Install
-------
Can be installed from the [Chrome Extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-position-customizer-2/jglbflnkbgbklegdblkohbbbheeeklej?hl=en&gl=US)

Or you can download the code, enable developer mode on the Chrome extensions page and add it with "Load unpacked extension".
